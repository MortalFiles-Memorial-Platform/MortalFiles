# Cemetery background — The hero slide behind "Where Memories Live Beyond Distance" now shows a hand-crafted atmospheric cemetery scene: a deep night-green sky with stars, a glowing moon, six species of tall cypress and weeping willow trees, scattered stone crosses and arched gravestones, rolling low grass hills with blade details, soft ground mist, and amber firefly lights. A subtle CSS wind animation gently shifts the mood overlay.
